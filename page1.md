first things getting started

- start timer
- do some research
    - decided on django it's easy/ good seo and google analytics
    - practicing code stuff is good too. fuck wordpress.
    - prolly gonna do docker and ecs or something like that
    - might as well do some automation or something too why not?
- need to track everything so first thing is set up spreadsheet until 
app is far enough along to use a db
- gonna probably put this on aws
    - need to track all expenses there
- stop research timer, start coding timer

- first steps:
    - set up virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper: 
    ```
    $ mkproject moneymachine
  
    ```
    - git stuff :
    ```
    $ git init
    $ touch README.md page1.md .gitignore articleides.md
    $ echo articleideas.md >> .gitignore
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/obscure-shadow/moneymachine.git
    $ git add all && git push origin master
    $ git checkout branch boilerplate

    ```
    - note i have alias for a lot of this stuff I will talk about that later
- start writing a bulleted outline of what I'm doing in page1.md
- will become the outline of my first article
- now we are ready to start coding use this tutorial: 
    - https://scotch.io/@CleverProgrammer/how-to-make-a-django-blog-app
    - done with boilerplate
    - fuck around with requirements.txt, pip-compile and pipdeptree for 
    an hour or so
- need to start a kanban board (wtf is up with that? i'll write about that later)
